# IaC Terraform code to support Fortgate CNF webinar
## Introduction
This project gives an example of a scenario using diferent AWS services and [Fortigate CNF](https://fortigatecnf.com/admin-portal/authentication/login), that is Fortinet FWaaS in AWS, to control and inspect traffic. Firtsly, one VPC with an GWLB endpoints to forward traffic to Fortigate CNF instance for traffic Inbound-Outbound and inter-subnet. Secondly, a complete scenario with a VPC inspection to control traffic between VPCs attached to TGW. Thirdly, an example of a SDWAN scenario with Fortigate as Cloud On-ramp integrated in a SDWAN customer network.
